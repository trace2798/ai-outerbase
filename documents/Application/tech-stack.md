### Tech Stack Used

The tech stack for this application is quite comprehensive. Itâ€™s a React application, with Next.js as the framework for server-rendered React applications. The application uses TypeScript for static typing, which can help catch errors during development.

For styling, it uses Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, along with autoprefixer and postcss for handling CSS prefixes and transformations. It also uses tailwind-merge and tailwindcss-animate for additional styling capabilities.

For state management, it appears to use next-themes, which is a lightweight dark mode plugin for Next.js.

There are also several other libraries included such as clsx, a tiny utility for constructing className strings conditionally.

Finally, the application uses Pinecone Vector Database as database to store vector embeddings.

The application also uses the langchain library to perform Semantic searches using the OpenAI model GPT-3.5.
